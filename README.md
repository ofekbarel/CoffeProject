# tools ðŸ’¼


In our project we use modern technologies and tools to improve and optimize the development, testing and deployment process.
In this project we use these tools especially and especially in the various devops processes.



## Continuous Integration and Delivery
  - **jenkins** : An open-source automation server that enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. Jenkins orchestrates our CI/CD pipeline, integrating seamlessly with GitHab for a smooth development     
     process. in this project used with multibranch pipeline t orun diffrent workflows.

## Containerization and Artifact Storage
  - **Docker** : Dockerize our application and storing the image, in Dockerhub.
     allows us to run and deploy the application without conditions and limitations, and to share with group members.

## Deployment
  - **argocd** : Argo CD is an open-source tool used for managing and automating the operation of applications in Kubernetes. It focuses on easily and safely managing and deploying applications in a Kubernetes environment..
    When using Argo CD, you define applications through relatively simple and readable YAML.
    The application definition includes all the necessary information to specify the import and deployment of the application in your Kubernetes environment.

## Kubernetes
  - **azure AKS** : Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes without needing to manage the underlying 
infrastructure.
With AKS, you can easily create, configure, and scale Kubernetes clusters in the Azure cloud. It provides integration with other Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory for authentication, Azure Monitor for monitoring, and Azure Container Registry for storing container images.
